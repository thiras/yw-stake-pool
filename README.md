A secure, flexible staking program for Solana that enables token holders to stake their SPL tokens and earn fixed rewards. Built with security-first principles and full support for Token-2022 extensions including transfer fees.

## Overview

YW Stake Pool is a production-ready Solana program that provides:

- **üîí Secure Staking** - Stake any SPL token or Token-2022 with transfer fee support
- **üí∞ Fixed Rewards** - Predictable rewards based on configurable reward rates
- **‚è±Ô∏è Flexible Lockup** - Customizable lockup periods per pool
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security Features** - Built-in protections against common vulnerabilities:
  - Type Cosplay Protection (account discriminators)
  - Frontrunning Protection (parameter verification)
  - Account Validation (ownership checks)
  - Two-step Authority Transfer
- **üîß Pool Management** - Full administrative controls for pool operators
- **üìä Multi-Pool Support** - Create unlimited pools with different parameters

## Features

### For Stakers
- **Stake** any supported SPL token
- **Earn** fixed rewards after lockup period
- **Claim** rewards at any time
- **Unstake** partially or fully (with early exit option)
- **Track** multiple stakes with indexed stake accounts

### For Pool Operators
- **Initialize** pools with custom parameters (reward rate, lockup, minimum stake)
- **Update** pool settings (pause/unpause, change rates)
- **Fund** reward vaults to ensure liquidity
- **Transfer** authority with two-step verification
- **Set** optional pool end dates

## Security

This program implements multiple security best practices:

1. **Type Cosplay Protection** - Account discriminators prevent type confusion attacks
2. **Frontrunning Protection** - Transactions can verify expected pool parameters
3. **Account Validation** - Comprehensive ownership and state validation
4. **Transfer Fee Support** - Properly handles Token-2022 transfer fees
5. **Numerical Overflow Protection** - All arithmetic uses checked operations
6. **Two-step Authority Transfer** - Prevents accidental authority loss

See [example/README.md](./example/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### Development

Build and test the program locally:

```sh
pnpm programs:build
pnpm programs:test
```

### Using the Client Library

Install the JavaScript/TypeScript client:

```sh
npm install @yourwallet/stake-pool
# or
pnpm add @yourwallet/stake-pool
```

Basic usage:

```typescript
import { 
  getInitializePoolInstruction,
  getStakeInstruction,
  getClaimRewardsInstruction,
} from '@yourwallet/stake-pool';

// Initialize a pool
const initIx = getInitializePoolInstruction({
  pool: poolAddress,
  authority: authority,
  stakeMint,
  rewardMint,
  stakeVault,
  rewardVault,
  payer: authority,
  tokenProgram: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  systemProgram: SYSTEM_PROGRAM_ID,
  rent: SYSVAR_RENT_PUBKEY,
  rewardRate: 100_000_000n,      // 10% APY
  minStakeAmount: 1_000_000n,    // 1 token (6 decimals)
  lockupPeriod: 86400n,          // 1 day
  poolEndDate: null,
});

// Stake tokens
const stakeIx = getStakeInstruction({
  pool: poolAddress,
  stakeAccount: stakeAccountAddress,
  owner: user,
  userTokenAccount,
  stakeVault,
  rewardVault,
  stakeMint,
  tokenProgram: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  payer: user,
  systemProgram: SYSTEM_PROGRAM_ID,
  amount: 100_000_000n,  // 100 tokens
  index: 0n,
});
```

See [clients/js/README.md](./clients/js/README.md) for full API documentation.

## Development

### Project Setup

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Managing programs

You'll notice a `program` folder in the root of this repository. This is where your generated Solana program is located.

Whilst only one program gets generated, note that you can have as many programs as you like in this repository.
Whenever you add a new program folder to this repository, remember to add it to the `members` array of your root `Cargo.toml` file.
That way, your programs will be recognized by the following scripts that allow you to build, test, format and lint your programs respectively.

```sh
pnpm programs:build
pnpm programs:test
pnpm programs:format
pnpm programs:lint
```

### Deploying programs

Deploy your program to a Solana cluster:

```sh
# Deploy to devnet (default)
pnpm programs:deploy

# Deploy to specific cluster
pnpm programs:deploy -- --cluster mainnet-beta

# Deploy with custom upgrade authority
pnpm programs:deploy -- --keypair /path/to/authority.json
```

The deploy script automatically detects the program ID from your repository keypairs.

### Managing authority

The project includes comprehensive authority management tools:

#### Program Upgrade Authority

Transfer or revoke program upgrade authority using Solana CLI:

```sh
# Transfer upgrade authority to a new address
pnpm programs:transfer-authority -- --new-authority <ADDRESS>

# Make program immutable (irreversible!)
pnpm programs:transfer-authority -- --none

# View help and options
pnpm programs:transfer-authority -- --help
```

This is a **one-step, immediate transfer** using Solana's native authority management. Use with caution!

#### Pool Operational Authority

Transfer pool operational authority using a secure two-step process:

```sh
# Step 1: Current authority nominates new authority
pnpm programs:pool:transfer-authority -- --pool <POOL_ADDRESS> --new-authority <ADDRESS>

# Step 2: New authority accepts the nomination
pnpm programs:pool:accept-authority -- --pool <POOL_ADDRESS>

# View help for each command
pnpm programs:pool:transfer-authority -- --help
pnpm programs:pool:accept-authority -- --help
```

The two-step process prevents accidental authority loss and ensures the new authority has access to their keypair before completing the transfer.

## Generating IDLs

You may use the following command to generate the IDLs for your programs.

```sh
pnpm generate:idls
```

Depending on your program's framework, this will either use Shank or Anchor to generate the IDLs.
Note that, to ensure IDLs are generated using the correct framework version, the specific version used by the program will be downloaded and used locally.

## Generating clients

Once your programs' IDLs have been generated, you can generate clients for them using the following command.

```sh
pnpm generate:clients
```

Alternatively, you can use the `generate` script to generate both the IDLs and the clients at once.

```sh
pnpm generate
```

## Managing clients

The following clients are available for your programs. You may use the following links to learn more about each client.

- [JS client](./clients/js)

## Starting and stopping the local validator

The following script is available to start your local validator.

```sh
pnpm validator:start
```

By default, if a local validator is already running, the script will be skipped. You may use the `validator:restart` script instead to force the validator to restart.

```sh
pnpm validator:restart
```

Finally, you may stop the local validator using the following command.

```sh
pnpm validator:stop
```

## Using external programs in your validator

If your program requires any external programs to be running, you'll want to in your local validator.

You can do this by adding their program addresses to the `program-dependencies` array in the `Cargo.toml` of your program.

```toml
program-dependencies = [
  "metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s",
  "noopb9bkMVfRPU8AsbpTUg8AQkHtKwMYZiFUjNRtMmV",
]
```

Next time you build your program and run your validator, these external programs will automatically be fetched from mainnet and used in your local validator.

```sh
pnpm programs:build
pnpm validator:restart
```
